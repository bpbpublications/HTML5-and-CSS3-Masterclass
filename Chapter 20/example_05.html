      Now is the winter of our dis&shy;con&shy;tent
      Made glor&shy;ious sum&shy;mer by this sun of York;
      And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
      In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
      Now are our brows bound with vic&shy;tor&shy;ious wreaths;
      Our bruised arms hung up for monu&shy;ments;
      Our stern alar&shy;ums changed to merry mee&shy;tings,
      Our drea&shy;dful marches to delight&shy;ful mea&shy;sures.
      Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrink&shy;led front;
      And now, instead of mount&shy;ing barded steeds
      To fright the souls of fear&shy;ful adver&shy;saries,
      He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
      To the las&shy;civ&shy;ious plea&shy;sing of a lute.
      But I, that am not shaped for sport&shy;ive tricks,
      Nor made to court an amor&shy;ous looking-glass;
      I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's maj&shy;esty
      To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
      I, that am cur&shy;tail'd of this fair prop&shy;ortion,
      Cheated of fea&shy;ture by dis&shy;semb&shy;ling nature,
      Defor&shy;med, unfin&shy;ish'd, sent before my time
      Into this brea&shy;thing world, scarce half made up,
      And that so lamely and un&shy;fash&shy;ion&shy;able
      That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
      Why, I, in this weak pip&shy;ing time of peace,
      Have no de&shy;light to pass away the time,
      Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
      And des&shy;cant on mine own deform&shy;ity:
      And there&shy;fore, since I cannot prove a lover,
      To enter&shy;tain these fair well-spoken days,
      I am deter&shy;mined to prove a villain
      And hate the idle plea&shy;sures of these days.
      Plots have I laid, induc&shy;tions danger&shy;ous,
      By drunken proph&shy;ecies, libels and dreams,
      To set my brother Clar&shy;ence and the king
      In deadly hate the one against the other:
      And if King Edward be as true and just
      As I am subtle, false and treach&shy;erous,
      This day should Clar&shy;ence closely be mew'd up,
      About a proph&shy;ecy, which says that 'G'
      Of Edward's heirs the murd&shy;erer shall be.
      Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
      Clar&shy;ence comes.
